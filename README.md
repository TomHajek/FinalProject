This is my final project from SDA (software development academy) python developer course.

The project serves as a playground to play with backend python django framework and frontend functionalities via javascript.  

So far, the project is still in development phase and is designed as online store.

I have plan to convert this project to "Green Swap" web page, where anyone could sell, buy or exchange their plants with other people.  
There will be also a blog section, where users could write articles or tips, how to keep your plant alive and what kind of products are the best for plants growth.
