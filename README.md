This is my final project from SDA (software development academy) python developer course.

I have decided to create "Green Swap" web page, where anyone can sell, buy or exchange their plants with other people. There is also blog section, where users can write articles or tips, how to keep your plant alive and what kind of products are the best for plants growth.
